We want a higher explained variance ratio value because this implies that our model will make better predictions. As we can see in the printed confusion matrix there are 4 false negatives and 4 false positives. In comparison to our true values this model does really well at correctly classifying vectors. This PCA does much better than the PCA with only 4 components because as shown in the classification report the precision and recall scores are much higher and extremely close to 1 but with the original PCA we had a precision in the .60s, showcasing an inaccurate model. Also this PCA with 30 components does better than the full model that we originally made in part 3. The precision for both models was above .90 but the PCA had a precision of .99 whereas the original full model has a precision score of .95."
